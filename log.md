# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: January 07, 2021 

**Today's Progress**: Started a Expense Tracker App using pure JS, worked on the draft layout.

**Initial Thought:** Quite excited for this challange, just hoping will be able to complete it. Wanted to refresh my JavaScript skill, I will continue with this types of small projects for next few days.

### Day 1: January 08, 2021 

**Today's Progress**: went through mdn's JS object and array section just to refresh stuff a bit, worked on Expense Tracker App's expense and Income section.

### Day 2: January 09, 2021 

**Today's Progress**: Worked on Edit, Delete Transaction and auto update Balance, I wasn't liking the UI design, so searched a little bit and switched to a different UI design and finally made a new repo for the expense tracker app.

**Link to Repo:** [Expense Tracker](https://github.com/TahirAnny/Expense_Tracker)

### Day 3: January 10, 2021 

**Today's Progress**: Added a chart to display income, expense ratio. Worked with **Local Storage** to save data, so that whenever a user comes again, they can access their previous entry. 

**Thoughts:** It was really cool to work with local storage
