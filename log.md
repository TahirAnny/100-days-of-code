Inspite of some of my personal and work related issues, sickness and leg injury, I am happy that I was able to finsih my node js course, Leanred a lot from Andrew Mead's this course, such a great instructor, though I wasn't able to code each and everyday. I know It's not the the rule of #100DaysOfCode, but I really don't wanna demotivate myself at which point I am, That's why I am gonna continue from here. My next target is to learn .Net core with React. Hopefully I will be able to finish this journey without any interruption InShaAllah. and one more update, I am gonna discontinue from Twitter, as I feel like these social media takes lots of time, All my updates will be here on GitHub only. Good Luck Tahira ❤

### Day 67-82: March 17 to April 04, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Well became very much irreguler to update my daily journal, before begening 100 days of code challenge I thought it's no big deal, it's actually hard to continue specially with a full time job. Had to skip 24th and 26th March due to some personal issue, still I really tried hard to make each and every minute count. What I did in last couple of days is - I was exploring .Net Core 5 by doing a project called Bulky Books, I started with a basic CRUD operation. Also learned about MVC request lifecycle- explored routing, HttpHandlers and HttpModules, controller initialization and action method execution etc. Then I studied on Design patterns in C#, and used repository pattern for this project, untestood Repository Pattern Detailed Flow, Architecture, Implemented Repository Interface for my project, then got to know about Unit of Work and tried to implement it in my project. here are some link that helped me to understand Unit Of Work ( 1. [Repository and Unit of Work Pattern](https://www.programmingwithwolfgang.com/repository-and-unit-of-work-pattern/) 2. [Unit Of Work — .NET Core](https://medium.com/@martinstm/unit-of-work-net-core-652f9b6cf894) 3. [Unit of Work Design Pattern](https://www.codeproject.com/Articles/581487/Unit-of-Work-Design-Pattern)) 
I beleive I needed to study more on design pattern but I continued with my project for now. Now I am working on entity framework core. 

### Day 83: April 05, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Got to know about Entity framework core and service providers, I was using code first approach in this project.  

### Day 84-96: April 06, 2021 - April 18, 2021

**Today's Progress**: I was working with user managerment in my project, Added user registration, user authorization, sign in with facebook or gmail, email send option after registaring an user, user unlock and lock option for user. It took a long time for me to build a user managerment system from scratch, I must say days spent well with all these good stuffs. Next my plan is to work with product and order management. 

### Day 97: April 19, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Today I worked on Poduct category and category type, Designed database tables, did CRUD operations, added required JS and view files 

### Day 98: April 20, 2021

### Day 99: April 21, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Worked on showng product details. Before working on cart management I wanted to do a little back ground check, how can I put products on cart in real time. So most of the tme spent doing R&D

### Day 100: April 22, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Worked on adding products in shooping cart, configured session.

NOTE: Well it's the 100th day, never expected I will be able to finish this challenge, despite having so many personal and work related issues and injury I must say it was a great journey. Though I planned to be lot more productive but somehow I could not. I want to start 2nd round of 100days of challenge, but before that I have some other planning, I will obviously continute with my project but it won't included as challenge.
