# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: January 07, 2021 

**Today's Progress**: Started a Expense Tracker App using pure JS, worked on the draft layout.

**Initial Thought:** Quite excited for this challange, just hoping will be able to complete it. Wanted to refresh my JavaScript skill, I will continue with this types of small projects for next few days.

### Day 1: January 08, 2021 

**Today's Progress**: went through mdn's JS object and array section just to refresh stuff a bit, worked on Expense Tracker App's expense and Income section.

### Day 2: January 09, 2021 

**Today's Progress**: Worked on Edit, Delete Transaction and auto update Balance, I wasn't liking the UI design, so searched a little bit and switched to a different UI design and finally made a new repo for the expense tracker app.

**Link to Repo:** [Expense Tracker](https://github.com/TahirAnny/Expense_Tracker)

### Day 3: January 10, 2021 

**Today's Progress**: Added a chart to display income, expense ratio. Worked with **Local Storage** to save data, so that whenever a user comes again, they can access their previous entry. 

**Thoughts:** It was really cool to work with local storage

### Day 4: January 11, 2021 

**Today's Progress**: Started a new small project, To-Do list app after finishing the previous one, Today I worked on day wise todo entry, mark the completed one and resetting the list.

**Today's Progress**: Well I always wanted to make a game using JS, so here I am, working on my hangman game. Also studied JavaScript Scope.

### Day 7: January 14, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Continued today with Scope, most of the time spent with scope and execution examples, lexical scope and how block scope works in ES6. Also worked on my
hangman gaming project, designed the UI and the workflow of the game.

### Day 8: January 15, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Hangman is on his way, Done with user input, well spent most of the how-to actually draw figures using CSS as I literally had no idea how to do that. Let's just see...

### Day 9: January 16, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Finished hangman app, not liking my man though, anyway I'll get back to it later and expand the word list. Now concentrating on Functional JS along with node. today I learned about closure.
